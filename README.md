# Bikcraft Demo Project

This project is a demo of the actual project I'm doing based on the course of the [Origamid.com](https://www.origamid.com/) I'm studying. In this project I am using the following techniques:

- CSS grid
- Flexbox
- HTML Semantic

## More details
Using the [VisBug tool](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/visbug/cdockenadnadldjbbgcallicgledbeoc) that gives you the possibility to see more carefully in addition to the devtools, the measurements of each container and element on the page.
